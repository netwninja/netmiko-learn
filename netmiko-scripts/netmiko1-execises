1. In the lab environment use Netmiko to connect to one of the Cisco NX-OS devices. You can find the IP addresses and username/passwords of the Cisco devices in the 'Lab Environment' email or alternatively in the ~/.netmiko.yml file. Simply print the router prompt back from this device to verify you are connecting to the device properly.

2. Add a second NX-OS device to your first exercise. Make sure you are using dictionaries to represent the two NX-OS devices. Additionally, use a for-loop to accomplish the Netmiko connection creation. Once again print the prompt back from the devices that you connected to.

3. For one of the Cisco IOS devices, use Netmiko and the send_command() method to retrieve 'show version'. Save this output to a file in the current working directory.
